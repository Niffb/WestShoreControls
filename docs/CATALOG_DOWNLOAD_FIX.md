# Catalog Download Fix - Updated for Google Cloud Hosting

## Issue
When users clicked the download button on the catalogs page, they were downloading HTML files instead of the actual PDF files. This was happening because the direct links to `/downloads/catalogs/filename.pdf` were being handled by Next.js routing instead of serving the static files directly.

**Additional Google Cloud Issues Addressed:**
- Memory issues with large PDF files (up to 141MB) in containerized environments
- Timeout issues for large file downloads
- File system access problems in Cloud Run containers
- Streaming download failures

## Root Cause
- Direct links to PDF files in the `/public/downloads/` directory were not being served with proper headers
- Browsers were receiving the HTML page response instead of the PDF file
- Missing `Content-Disposition: attachment` header to force download behavior
- Incorrect content-type headers
- **NEW**: Synchronous file operations causing issues in Google Cloud's containerized environment
- **NEW**: Large file downloads exhausting container memory
- **NEW**: Lack of proper error handling and fallbacks for cloud hosting

## Solution
Enhanced the API route handler at `/app/api/download/[...path]/route.ts` with:

1. **Properly serves PDF files** with correct content-type (`application/pdf`)
2. **Forces download behavior** using `Content-Disposition: attachment` header
3. **Includes security checks** to prevent path traversal attacks
4. **Provides proper caching** with `Cache-Control` headers
5. **Includes logging** for debugging purposes
6. **NEW: Streaming downloads** for large files (>10MB) to prevent memory issues
7. **NEW: Async file operations** for better cloud compatibility
8. **NEW: Enhanced error handling** with detailed logging
9. **NEW: Fallback mechanisms** in the frontend for failed downloads
10. **NEW: Health check endpoint** for diagnosing issues

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced API Route
- **File**: `app/api/download/[...path]/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handle all catalog downloads through a controlled endpoint with cloud optimizations
- **NEW Features**:
  - Streaming downloads for files >10MB to prevent memory exhaustion
  - Async file operations using `fs.promises` for better cloud compatibility
  - Proper error handling with detailed logging
  - Fallback from streaming to buffer method if needed
  - Enhanced security headers

### 2. Updated Frontend Error Handling
- **File**: `components/page/CatalogsPage.tsx`
- **NEW Features**:
  - Pre-flight checks using HEAD requests
  - Fallback to direct file access if API route fails
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Prevent default link behavior for better control

### 3. Enhanced Next.js Configuration
- **File**: `next.config.js`
- **Additions**: 
  - Additional security headers for download endpoints
  - Proper trailing slash handling
  - Enhanced caching configuration for static files

### 4. NEW: Health Check Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/download/health/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Diagnose file system access and environment issues
- **Features**:
  - Check directory accessibility
  - List available catalog files
  - Verify file permissions
  - Environment information

### 5. NEW: Test Script
- **File**: `test-downloads.js`
- **Purpose**: Verify download functionality works before deployment
- **Usage**: Run `node test-downloads.js` after starting dev server

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test download endpoints
node test-downloads.js

# Or test manually
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/download/catalogs/noark-product-catalogue.pdf

# Expected response includes:
# content-type: application/pdf
# content-disposition: attachment; filename="noark-product-catalogue.pdf"
# content-length: [file_size]
```

### Production Testing on Google Cloud
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-domain.com/api/download/health

# Test small file download
curl -I https://your-domain.com/api/download/catalogs/noark-product-catalogue.pdf

# Test large file download (streaming)
curl -I https://your-domain.com/api/download/catalogs/2025-les-product-catalogue.pdf
```

## Files Available
All catalog files are properly located in `/public/downloads/catalogs/`:
- `2025-les-product-catalogue.pdf` (141 MB) - **Uses streaming**
- `noark-product-catalogue.pdf` (6.5 MB)
- `automation-klemsan.pdf` (12 MB) - **Uses streaming**
- `klemsan-accessories.pdf` (6.8 MB)
- `katko-product-catalogue-2021.pdf` (41 MB) - **Uses streaming**
- All Elsteel brochures (7 files, some use streaming)

## Security Features
- Path traversal protection prevents accessing files outside the downloads directory
- Proper content-type validation with security headers
- Enhanced logging for security monitoring
- CSP headers for download endpoints

## Cloud Hosting Optimizations
1. **Memory Management**: Streaming for large files prevents container memory exhaustion
2. **Async Operations**: All file system operations use async methods
3. **Error Recovery**: Fallback mechanisms for various failure scenarios
4. **Health Monitoring**: Dedicated endpoint for diagnosing issues
5. **Container Compatibility**: Verified to work with Docker and Google Cloud Run

## Benefits
1. ✅ **Proper PDF downloads** instead of HTML files
2. ✅ **Forced download behavior** - files are saved, not opened in browser
3. ✅ **Security protection** against path traversal attacks
4. ✅ **Better performance** with proper caching headers
5. ✅ **Easy debugging** with comprehensive logging
6. ✅ **Consistent behavior** across all browsers and devices
7. ✅ **NEW: Cloud hosting compatibility** with Google Cloud Run
8. ✅ **NEW: Memory efficient** handling of large files
9. ✅ **NEW: Robust error handling** with user feedback
10. ✅ **NEW: Production monitoring** with health checks

## Troubleshooting

If downloads still fail on Google Cloud:

1. **Check health endpoint**: Visit `/api/download/health` to verify file system access
2. **Check logs**: Monitor Cloud Run logs for detailed error information
3. **Verify container build**: Ensure `public/downloads` directory is included in Docker image
4. **Test locally**: Use the test script to verify functionality before deployment
5. **Check memory limits**: Increase Cloud Run memory allocation if needed for large files

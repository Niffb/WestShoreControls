## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Conversion Process
Created a Node.js conversion script that:
- Reads all JSON files from `scraped_data/` directory
- Converts raw scraped data to `Product` interface format
- Detects and categorizes brands using pattern matching
- Generates realistic pricing, ratings, and reviews
- Creates separate TypeScript files for each brand-category combination

### 2. Brand Detection Algorithm
Implemented intelligent brand detection using keyword patterns:
```javascript
const brandPatterns = {
  'Noark': ['noark', 'ex9', 'b1n', 'b1h', 'b1d', 'b1e', 'b1nq'],
  'Mitsubishi': ['mitsubishi', 'melsec', 'iq-', 'fr-', 'alpha'],
  'General Electric': ['general electric', 'ge '],
  // ... 70+ brand patterns
}
```

### 3. Generated Files Structure
```
